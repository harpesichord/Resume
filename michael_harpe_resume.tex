\section{EXPERIENCE} 
\textbf{Southeastern Underwriters} \textit{Business Analyst} \hfill May 2012 - Present \\
As a business analyst my responsibilities include performing help desk tasks by troubleshooting and solving employee computer software and hardware problems. I administer the windows servers on the company's network. I design and implement in house insurance software systems written in C\# using the agile development method, as well as building the corresponding Visual Foxpro databases to process data and display it to employees in a user friendly manner. I oversee these projects from start to finish, from collecting requirements to building the whole system. I have worked on large scale projects that were in development for 6 months as well as smaller projects that make day to day processes more efficient. My job also requires direct communication with our company's clients to resolve website related issues.\\ [10pt]

\textbf{International Mission Board} \textit{Global Technology Services Intern} \hfill Summer 2011 \\
As a summer intern I assisted in a full system development life cycle using the Agile development method. I gathered information from users to determine software requirements. I designed and developed asp.net web pages in C\# allowing users to input data. Using SQL Server Management Studio I wrote queries and stored procedures, to retrieve and store data from the company database. I also tested the web pages and created a test group from the user base.\\ [10pt]

As a summer intern I diagnosed and repaired software and hardware issues on employee computers. I created hard drive images and then used them to image multiple computers at once.
